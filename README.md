## Getting Started

**FIRST OF ALL:**

- Without the dependencies, the project will not run.

- To install the dependencies:

**npm install**

_To run the development server:_

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

- [Aside Section](#aside-section)
- [Modal Section](#modal-section)

## Treemap

The Treemap component is a core part of the application. It renders a treemap graph using React Flow, visually representing nodes (topics) and edges (relationships between topics). It includes features like automatic layout using dagre, custom node rendering, and interactive functionalities.

- [Props](#Props)
- [Component Logic](#Component-Logic)
- [Key Functionalities](#Key-Functionalities)
- [CustomNode Component](#CustomNode-Component)
- [initialNodes and initialEdges](#initialnodes-and-initialedges)

### Treemap Structure

For this Treemap Graph we use react flow for graph rendering, node/edge management, and controls.
To handles automatic layouting of nodes we use Dagre.
To manage modal state to display additional node information we use a custom context called [useIsModalOpenContext].(#useIsModalOpenContext)

**Dagre Layout Calculation**

- **getLayoutedElements**: A utility function that calculates and applies a top-to-bottom (TB) layout for nodes and edges using dagre.
- Adjusts node positions based on calculated layout from dagre.

# Component Logic

**State and Memoization:**

- nodes and edges: Derived from initialNodes and initialEdges, processed through getLayoutedElements for layout.
- nodeTypes: Defines a custom rendering for nodes using useMemo.

**Event Handlers:**

- handleNodeClick: Triggered when a node is clicked. It opens a modal with the node's ID.

**Custom Node Rendering**

- Nodes are styled with Tailwind CSS and have hover effects.

**Handle components:**

- Rendered conditionally to indicate input (target) and output (source) connections.
- Clicking a node triggers the handleNodeClick function to open the modal.

**Edge Styling**

- Custom edge styles (color, width, arrow marker) are applied dynamically.

**React Flow Configuration**

- Nodes and Edges: Rendered with calculated layout and custom styling.
- Controls: Provides UI controls for panning and zooming.

## Key Functionalities

1. Automatic Layout

- The getLayoutedElements function uses dagre to calculate the optimal position of nodes and edges in a top-to-bottom structure.
- Ensures that nodes donâ€™t overlap and are spaced correctly.

2. Interactive Nodes

- Nodes are interactive and styled dynamically:
- Incoming and Outgoing Connections: Visualized using Handle components.
- On Click: Triggers a modal with additional node details (via handleNodeClick).

3. Custom Styling

- Nodes: Styled with Tailwind CSS (bg-purpleLogo, hover:bg-customPurpleBtn, etc.).
- Edges: Styled with a green stroke (--greenLogo) and custom arrow markers.

4. React Flow Integration

- Nodes and Edges: Dynamically rendered and styled.
- Controls: Enables zooming and panning for better graph exploration.
- FitView: Ensures the graph fits into the viewport.

## Props

### initialNodes and initialEdges

- Imported from a utility file (graphInfo).
- Contains the raw data for nodes and edges in the graph.

### useIsModalOpenContext

- Provides access to the setIsPrincipalModalSectionOpen function for managing modal visibility and node-specific data.

# CustomNode Component

Customizes the appearance and behavior of nodes rendered in the graph.

**Features:**

- Displays a label.
- Conditional rendering of Handle components:
- Input Handle (Position.Top): If the node has incoming edges.
- Output Handle (Position.Bottom): If the node has outgoing edges.
- Click functionality to open the modal.

# Aside Section

The AsideSection component is a sidebar. It provides navigation options (e.g., selecting a roadmap), displays progress with a progress bar, and includes a tooltip for additional guidance.

- [Aside Section Props](#aside-section-props)
- [Aside Section States](#aside-section-states)

- [Aside Section Key Functionalities](#aside-section-key-functionalities)

## Aside Section Structure

**Custom Components**

- ProgressBar: A reusable progress bar component.
- Context: useUserInfoContext to access user-related data.

**Key Sections**

- Header: Provides roadmap selection options (e.g., "Algorithms" and "Courses").
- Progress Bar: Displays the user's progress as a percentage of completed tasks.
- Footer: Includes a button with a tooltip for additional information.

## Aside Section Props

### Context Dependency

- userTotalProblemsStatusChecked: Represents the number of problems completed by the user out of a total of 150.

## Aside Section States

### State

**progressBarValue:**

- Tracks the progress value as a percentage.
- Initialized to 0 and updated via the useEffect hook.

## Aside Section Effects

### Effect

**useEffect:**

- Watches changes to userTotalProblemsStatusChecked.
- Calculates progress as (userTotalProblemsStatusChecked / 150) \* 100.
- Updates the progressBarValue state accordingly.
- Prevents calculations when userTotalProblemsStatusChecked is 0.

## Aside Section Key Functionalities

**Roadmap Selection**

- Two buttons (Algorithms and Courses) let the user select different roadmaps.
- Buttons include hover and active states, styled for smooth transitions using Tailwind CSS.

**Progress Bar**

- Displays the progress as a bar using the ProgressBar component.
- Accompanied by a text representation of progress in the format (X / 150).

**Tooltip**

- Wraps a button with a Material-UI QuestionMarkTwoToneIcon.
- Explains the purpose of the sidebar with the tooltip message: "What is this?".

# Modal Section

The ModalSection component serves as a modal interface that dynamically displays detailed information based on user interactions. It includes a progress bar, a list of prerequisites, and a data table. The modal fetches and processes data from both Firebase and local storage, ensuring the user's progress and related information are presented correctly.

- Progress Tracking: Updates progress bar data whenever tableData changes.
- Data Saving: Saves user progress either to Firebase or local storage.

# Contexts

To ensure that the code would be clean and the application would have access to all of the shared states, we've encapsulate the context into a single wrapper which is called **ProviderWrapper**.
Here you can see the contexts that compose the Provider:
